# Machina-Processing
Real-time robot control with Processing

_Work in progress, more info and samples to come soon_

A simple example on how to use the Machina wrapper class to drive robots in real-time through Processing.

Instructions:
  - Download and execute the Machina Bridge App from https://github.com/RobotExMachina/Machina-Bridge
  - Run it and connect to your physical/virtual robot.
  - Download the WebSockets library for Processing from the contributions manager.
  - Run this sketch. You should see a message pop up on the console log of your robot.
  - Build your own project starting with this boilerplate.
  - See sample files in this repo for more elaborate examples.
